			about: {
				text: [
					" In August of 2017 Trevor began his journey into web development. The passion for building websites grew, and a few online courses quickly turned into more and more elaborate projects and late evenings coding, Now, Trevor is studying full-time with the intent to build a career in the tech world.",
					"Before the career change, Trevor was employed restoring historical building around Canada's capital, making use of his college education as a heritage woodworker. Although seemingly worlds apart, woodworking and coding share many skill sets. Problem solving, effective utilization of resources, and focus on product delivery have all been assets across the two disciplines.",
					"Trevor mainly works in JavaScript, namely React.js, but has been known to code in C. You can expect him to easily handle most HTML and CSS tasks. He'd probably use Sass, Redux and Gulp to build a big project, but he's not picky. He's also got a good handle on RESTful API's, and before he devoted his efforts to SPA's he used Bootstrap and jQuery quite a bit. If you're thinking 'would Trevor be good at learning <i>this</i> particular tool?' the answer is always Yes."

				"Hogan here,  Listen. If you need an About page to know who I am, then you may very well be beyond help. Or a millenial. And that's a shame, because that means  you've missed out on the glory days of what may possibly be the greatest professional wrestler of all time, brother. You also don't get fun playground equipment anymore, like those merry-go-rounds.",
				"Anyways, I ought to get you up to speed. back in the 80's I made a name for myself jumping off of dudes from on top of ladders in the ol' WWE, but it was called the WWF back then. Not that we were wrestling pandas or anything those days, at least not publicly. Although sometimes I wish we could have, those bastards could take a metal chair to the back better than anyone. Or, so I've heard. I'm losing the plot here. Thanks to my glistening showmanship and impeccable fashion taste, not to mention a whole lotta elbows to the noggin', I ended up the WWF Champion. This would happen another five times or so, which is good for me, because I cannot remember a THING about winning that first one.",
				"Around here's when I noticed people were noticing, and I figured 'hey, why don't I make a buck off this' so I did what anybody would do, and started my own restaurant in a shopping mall. I called it Pastamaniacs, and it was glorious. And it performed admirably as a food court restaurant, getting nearly a whole year of operation under its belt.",
				"Anywho after that was some movies, action figures, night show appearances, the whole bit. Then the 2000's happened, and I gotta say, that decade hit me about as hard as it hit America as a whole. Which is to say, not good. But here we are now, and I got my new website all runnin' which is good, because my phone certainly isn't ringing as much as it used to.",				"",
